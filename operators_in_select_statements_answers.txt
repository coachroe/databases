1) Write out a generic SELECT statement.

  SELECT [some column or all columns(*)]
  FROM [table_name]
  WHERE [some value in a column]

-----

2) Create a fun way to remember the order of operations in a SELECT statement, such as a mnemonic.
  PEMDAS
  People eat meat daily at six

-----

3) Given this dogs table, write queries to select the following pieces of data:

  Intake teams typically guess the breed of shelter dogs, so the breed column may have multiple words (for example, "Labrador Collie mix").

  Display the name, gender, and age of all dogs that are part Labrador.
    SELECT name, gender, age
    FROM dogs
    WHERE breed LIKE '%labrador%'

  Display the ids of all dogs that are under 1 year old.
    SELECT id
    FROM dogs
    WHERE age < 1

  Display the name and age of all dogs that are female and over 35lbs.
    SELECT name, age
    FROM dogs
    WHERE gender = 'F'
      AND weight > 35

  Display all of the information about all dogs that are not Shepherd mixes.
    SELECT *
    FROM dogs
    WHERE breed NOT LIKE '%Shepherd%'

  Display the id, age, weight, and breed of all dogs that are either over 60lbs or Great Danes.
    SELECT id, age, weight, breed
    FROM dogs
    WHERE (weight > 60 OR breed LIKE '%Great Dane%')

-----

4) Given this cats table, what records are returned from these queries?

  SELECT name, adoption_date FROM cats;
    ('Mushi','2016-03-22'),
    ('Seashell',NULL),
    ('Azul','2016-04-17'),
    ('Victoire','2016-09-01'),
    ('Nala',NULL);

  SELECT name, age FROM cats;
    ('Mushi',1),
    ('Seashell',7),
    ('Azul',3),
    ('Victoire',7),
    ('Nala',1);

-----

5) From the cats table, write queries to select the following pieces of data.
  Display all the information about all of the available cats.
    SELECT *
    FROM cats

  Display the name and sex of all cats who are 7 years old.
    SELECT name, gender
    FROM cats
    WHERE age = 7

  Find all of the names of the cats, so you don’t choose duplicate names for new cats.
    SELECT name
    FROM cats

-----

6) List each comparison operator and explain when you would use it. Include a real world example for each.
If you can’t list these from memory, do these flashcards until you can!
  < Less than - finding people less than 50 years old
  > greater than - determining who won the outcome of a game that cannot end in a tie
  <= less than or equal to - a children's play area that only allows kids 10 and under
  >= greater than or equal to - the legal drinking age (>= 21)
  != not equal to - determining if the sides of a boat don't have equal occupants
  = equal to - determining if the sides of a boat have equal occupants
  LIKE pattern matching - names like '%Bill%' (i.e. Billy, Bill, Billy Bob)

-----

7) From the cats table, what data is returned from these queries?
  SELECT name FROM cats WHERE gender = ‘F’;
    Seashell,
    Nala

  SELECT name FROM cats WHERE age <> 3;
    Mushi,
    Seashell,
    Victoire,
    Nala

  SELECT ID FROM cats WHERE name != ‘Mushi’ AND gender = ‘M’;
    Azul,
    Victoire
